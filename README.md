# Battleships

A localhost web game where you can you can add a Ship (Battle, Cargo or Patrol) into your collection and attack another players.

My project for the Spring Fundamentals course at SoftUni. (May 2022)

## :hammer_and_pick: How it works:
- Anonymous users:
  * can register
  * can login in case of existing account

- Logged usersr:
  * can add ship
  * can fight another user's ship
